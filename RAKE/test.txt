Issuing a defiant call to arms to grassroots Republicans former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon railed Friday against dangerous global elites and the Silicon Valley lords of technology whom he said are robbing US citizens of jobs wealth and opportunity They want all the benefits of a free societyall the benefits of this rulesbased international order including lucrative trade deals and capital markets he said while we the citizens of the United Statesunderwrite the whole thingBannon also launched a blistering attack on a former President George W Bush who this week delivered a rebuke of President Donald Trump casting him as a tool of those globalistsPresident Bush embarrassed himself Bannon said referring to him as a piece of work It is clear he didnt understanding anything he was talking abouthe had no idea whether he was coming or going just like when he was president of the United StatesThere has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bushs he said to applauseBannon delivered the comments to a wildly enthusiastic soldout crowd of 500 at the state GOP convention where he was greeted with a standing ovation Security was tight with double lines of fencing outside the Anaheim Marriott and lines of police officers on hand for protesters who promised to show up but never materialized in large numbersDelegates paid 100 for dinner with the former White House senior adviser who has returned to his post as Breitbart News executive chairman and many ponied up 300 for a goldplated pass that included a VIP reception and a photo with Bannon the kind of buyin usually reserved for elected officials and rock stars Entering the convention hall Bannon was greeted with cheers and mobbed by party activists aiming to grab selfiesIn his address to California Republicans much of it delivered offthecuff Bannon aimed squarely at some favorite conservative targets including sanctuary citiesYouve got a very dangerous thing going on in this state said Bannon likening California in 2017 to South Carolina in the 1830s a state he said also tried to pick and choose the laws they want before it it pulled away from the Union You are a sanctuary state and trust me if you do not roll this back 10 or 15 years from now the folks in Silicon Valley and the progressive left in this state are going to try to secede from the UnionBut Bannon the former Harvard Business School grad Goldman Sachs managing director and Hollywood mogul cast California as a linchpin in the fight to halt the spread of what he called the globalist and elitist agenda He urged Republicans to organize rise up and put up a fight to hold on to California House seats that are considered vulnerable in 2018Its time for California to start having some victories he said Progressives are going to drag us so far to the left that were going to hold those districts and Nancy Pelosi is not going to get her opportunity to impeach the president of the United StatesBannon in his 40minute address didnt disappoint an adoring crowd casting himself as a populist conservative and political pugilist who has kicked off an epic battle between old guard establishment Republicans and his army of activist followers in the 2018 midtermsTo many in the audience who greeted Bannons speech with cheers and shouts the Breitbart executives decision to take his fight to solidly blue California a state where Democrats hold a 15point voter registration advantage every major statewide office and supermajorities in both houses of the legislature served as a shot of adrenaline to a state party that has slipped to near irrelevanceSome Republicans greeted Bannons choice of targets with praiseHarmeet Dhillon the San Francisco attorney who is also a member of the Republican National Committee and who represents James Damore the Google engineer who was fired earlier this year after writing a controversial memo on diversity said she welcomed Bannons focus on Silicon ValleyFor every James Damore theres a thousand others who get fired said Dhillon who has also represented UC Berkeley College Republicans in their efforts to bring conservative speakers like Milo Yiannopoulos to campus Silicon Valley corporations like Twitter Googlesystematically suppress the voices of conservative bloggers voices and citizens So think they should be taken to task on free speech issuesBut other activists in attendance expressed concerns that Bannon was overly divisiveConyers Davis who worked in George W Bushs administration said after the speech that Bannons rhetoric was really scary contrasting it with what he called a message of civility from Bush in New York the previous dayBush he said is a proven winner And if you look at the current administration theyre doing anything but winningYet Bannons attacks on establishment politicians were generally well received When he mentioned Arizona Republican Sen John McCain the former POW whose name was met with boos someone in the audience yelled Hang him!Here in Orange County the oncevaunted stronghold of Republican conservatism Bannons presence fired up hardright conservatives who charged that the collapse of the California GOP is directly related to efforts to moderate the party message and capitulate on issues like illegal immigration antiterrorism efforts free trade and globalismIntellectually and ideologically the energy of what is left of the conservative movement here is absolutely with Bannon and hes the only reason a lot of these people are coming to the convention said Tim Donnelly a former state assemblyman and cofounder of the Minutemen and a selfdeclared member of Bannons antiestablishment wing of the partyBannons draw is that he represents the complete opposite of establishment state GOP leaders like its chairman Jim Brulte a former state senator whom Donnelly charged has turned the party into Democrats lite and wants to hand over the state to people who are in the country illegally at the cost of the future of Californias kidsDonnelly last week became the first California candidate to seize on Bannons call for war and launched a challenge against GOP Rep Paul Cook charging that he alone will have President Trumps back on key issues Donnelly met with Bannon prior to the speech  but the Breitbart executive has yet to endorse any candidates in California racesBannon sought to reassure the embattled party activists that the GOP could take back the reins in a majorityminority state that is increasingly tacking to the leftIt looks like now its impossible to do anything in California he said The medias against you the cultures against youbut you have got everything you need to winyouve got big ideas you have the grassroots youve got muscleHe urged conservatives to support Trumps agenda adding the future of this state is in your hands I mean thatBannon is not universally known among California Republicans but he has considerable support Among California Republicans 41 percent view Bannon favorably and 33 percent unfavorably according to a poll of California voters by Sextant Strategies for Capitol WeeklyStill some centrist Republicans expressed concern that Bannons appearance would be taken as a signal that in California birthplace of the Reagan Revolution the GOP grassroots is ready to embrace some of the strategists nationalist positionsLuis Alvarado a longtime party strategist who has declared himself a #NeverTrump Republican said he could only hope that Bannons address will not be something that causes harm a reference to white nationalist antiimmigrant and antiSemitic groups who have appeared to be energized by both Breitbart coverage and Bannon himself
